# Environment Setup

A simple script that sets up a environment with a nice looking PS1, and some helpful short aliases for git

### Usage
`cd` into the cloned directory and do the following for help
```
./setup.sh help
```

You can also install it and run it with one command by doing:
```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twosk/alias/refs/heads/master/setup.sh | bash
```

Once `./setup.sh` or `./setup aliases` is run, you can use `gh` for a list of aliases
